      <p>
        Due to the coronavirus a lot of college students are having difficulty finding a job, whether that be an internship or a full-time position. We recognize that a lot of the tools available pre-covid such as mock interviews and in-person workshops are no longer available. So, we created InterviewBuddy at StormHacks 2021. An online tool that provides feedback to the answers you give during the one-way interview.

        This hack won 2nd place at StormHacks 2021. Check out our presentation here: https://youtu.be/YCDsf2Melog
